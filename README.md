**Maze Game Project**

## Overview
The Maze Game Project is an interactive web-based game that allows users to navigate through a maze. Players can choose between single-player and multiplayer modes to challenge themselves or play with friends. The game is built using Python for the backend logic and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend interface.

## Features
- **Single-Player Mode:** Players can navigate through a maze on their own.
- **Multiplayer Mode:** Players can compete with each other to see who can navigate the maze the fastest.
- **Dynamic Maze Generation:** The maze is generated dynamically, providing a unique experience each time.
- **Responsive Design:** The game interface is designed to work well on various screen sizes and devices.
- **Interactive Controls:** Users can control their movement using arrow keys or touch controls.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Used for the backend logic, including maze generation and game mechanics.
- **HTML:** Used for structuring the web page and displaying the game interface.
- **CSS:** Used for styling the game interface, including colors, fonts, and layout.
- **JavaScript:** Used for adding interactivity to the game, including button clicks and player movement.
- **Flask:** Used as the web framework to serve the game files and handle requests.
- **Pygame:** Used for creating the graphical user interface and handling game events in Python.

## How It Works
1. **Maze Generation:** When the game starts, the maze is dynamically generated using a recursive backtracking algorithm. This algorithm creates a maze with a single solution path from the starting point to the exit.
2. **Game Interface:** The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files provide the user interface for the game. The HTML file defines the structure of the page, the CSS file styles the elements, and the JavaScript file adds interactivity to the buttons and player controls.
3. **Backend Logic:** The Python files contain the backend logic for the game, including maze generation, player movement, and game rules. The Flask framework is used to serve these files to the web browser and handle requests from the frontend.
4. **Player Interaction:** Players can interact with the game using arrow keys or touch controls to navigate through the maze. In multiplayer mode, players compete to see who can reach the exit first.

## Getting Started
To play the Maze Game, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install Python and Flask if you haven't already.
3. Navigate to the project directory and run the Flask server using the command `python app.py`.
4. Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to access the game.
5. Choose between single-player and multiplayer modes and start playing!

## Future Improvements
- **Enhanced Graphics:** Add more visual elements and animations to improve the overall look and feel of the game.
- **Leaderboards:** Implement a leaderboard system to track high scores and player achievements.
- **Customizable Mazes:** Allow users to customize maze parameters such as size, complexity, and difficulty level.
- **Mobile Optimization:** Optimize the game interface for better performance on mobile devices and touchscreen controls.
