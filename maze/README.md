This directory contains files required to play a simple yet fun 2-D maze game designed by Samson Wayne in Python. This is an open source project.

The maze generation process was inspired by the video game Pacman, and coded using pygame module to handle maze generation. @DataWizual was instrumental in assisting in the correction and implementation of the game logic, to ensure an error free experience.
